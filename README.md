## About the Course

The Tokio Couse is designed to provide participants with a comprehensive understanding of Java programming language fundamentals and Object-Oriented Programming principles. Through a series of lectures, hands-on exercises, and projects, participants will gain practical experience in developing Java applications using OOP concepts. I am having a great experience in this formation.

## Projects Overview

This repository contains the following projects completed as part of the course:

- [Animal Heritage](https://github.com/domingosneto03/Tokio/tree/main/OOP/Animal%20Heritage)
- [Bank Account](https://github.com/domingosneto03/Tokio/tree/main/OOP/Bank%20Account)
- [School System](https://github.com/domingosneto03/Tokio/tree/main/OOP/School%20System)
- [Shadow SLave](https://github.com/domingosneto03/Tokio/tree/main/OOP/Shadow%20Slave)

Each project focuses on different aspects of Java programming and Object-Oriented Programming principles, providing hands-on experience with various concepts and techniques.

## Project Descriptions

Here's a brief description of each project:

1. **Animal Heritage**: This is a small project where the user can create an animal of its choice. The focus is mainly on the class heritage and its applications.
2. **Bank Account**: A project where the user can open a bank account and exploit its features. The purpose of this work is to understand encapsulation where the programmer uses different access types to classes.
3. **School System**: In this scenario, the user is a school coordinator where he can admit new students to attend his school.
4. **Shadow Slave**: This project simulates a fight game between characters of the novel Shadow Slave. It is a 1v1 for two players that have to use easy strategy to win. The objective of the project is to understand the fundamentals of the use of interfaces.

For detailed documentation for each project, refer to the respective project folders.
